  <a href="https://opendreamkit.org/">OpenDreamKit</a>, whose name stands for
  "Open Digital Research Environment Toolkit for the Advancement of Mathematics",
  was a European project to create and strengthen virtual research environments
  in the field of mathematics and related fields.<br/>
  It brought together software communities from mathematical software packages
  such as <a href="http://www.gap-system.org/">GAP</a>,
  <a href="https://linalg.org/">LinBox</a>,
  <a href="http://www.lmfdb.org/">LMFDB</a>,
  <a href="http://www.mpir.org/">MPIR</a>,
  <a href="http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/">PARI/GP</a>,
  <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a>,
  <a href="https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/">Singular</a>,
  but also simulation tools from materials science such as
  <a href="http://joommf.github.io/">OOMMF</a>
  and general computational software such as
  <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a>.<br/>
  OpenDreamKit was funded from 2015 to 2019 by the ``Horizon 2020''
  European Research Infrastructures Work Program (as project #676541).<br/>
  OpenDreamKit was very active in developing and disseminating
  software tools and best practices. It organised or funded,
  or had members participate in several Software Carpentry workshops.<br/>
